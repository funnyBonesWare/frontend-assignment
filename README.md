- Display a table of projects.
- Handle pagination for large datasets.
- Show a loading state and error state based on data fetching.

- **Responsive Design**: The app is mobile-friendly and works seamlessly across devices.
- **Error Handling**: The app gracefully handles loading and error states when fetching data.
